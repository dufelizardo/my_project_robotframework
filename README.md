# My Project ROBOTFRAMEWORK

## Project Structure

Here is a typical project structure for a Robot Framework project:

```
robot-framework-project/
│
├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── home_page.robot
│   │   ├── login_page.robot
│   ├── resources/
│   │   ├── locators.robot
│   │   ├── custom_library.py
│   ├── keywords/
│   │   ├── page_keywords.robot
│
├── tests/
│   ├── example_test.robot
│   ├── another_test.robot
│
├── reports/
│   ├── log.html
│   ├── report.html
│
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── robotframework-project.py

```
### **Directory Descriptions**

- **`tests/`**: Contains your test cases, written in `.robot` files. Each file can contain multiple test cases and keywords.
- **`pages/`**: Contains Page Object Model (POM) files, which represent different pages or components of your application.
- **`resources/`**: Contains shared resources like locators, custom libraries, and reusable variables.
- **`keywords/`**: Contains custom keywords that combine actions or logic specific to your testing needs.
- **`reports/`**: Stores test execution reports and logs. Typically, these files are generated automatically after running tests.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies for your project, such as `robotframework`, `selenium`, etc.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file that provides an overview of the project and instructions.
- **`robotframework-project.py`**: If you have custom Python scripts for managing or extending Robot Framework functionalities.
